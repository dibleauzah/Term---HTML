     <h3> 
        Welcome!
        Please Note: this website’s sister site, for applied organizational and strategic communication research and consulting can be found via this link:

     </h3>
     <p>Thanks for visiting our site.</p>

     <p>The Higher-Ed Exchange consulting agency is your premier guide through the myriad priceless higher education opportunities of the USA. East African middle class families who know the value of a world-class education have long sought education in the UK and Europe, South Africa, India, among other nations.</p>

     <p>But for a number of reasons, the US higher education system has mystified and discouraged numerous families from pursuing their dream of a quality university education.</p>

     <p>That’s where we come in. Via this site, meetings with the HigherEdExchange East African regional director, and correspondence with the US-based chief consultant, parents and students will be taken step-by-step through the process of researching, applying to, and succeeding in American colleges* and universities.</p>

     <p>—————————————</p>
     <p>
        *In the USA, the word “college” denotes a university. Many colleges are of a smaller size compared to bigger universities, but their academic ranking is often the same, or higher. These institutions also often confer advanced (Masters and Doctorate) degrees.</p>
